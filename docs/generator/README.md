Terraform Contrail Provider Generator
============================

Juniper team has developed a generator of `go` code according to contrail api. After it was archived and now it comes to life.

For generation sources you need stay onto `contrail-generateDS:94b3381` commit revision and apply patches of contrail-generateDS juniper opensource project from contrail-generateDS folder. (see `bundle-me.sh` script)

If you use `https` client, then apply `0001-Changed client to https.patch` for `contrail-go-api` project.
