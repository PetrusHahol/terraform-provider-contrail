## Contrail provider 

The Contrail provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by Contrail and Openstack. 
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.
We don't have contrail provider upstream in terraform, now all sources are located [here](https://github.com/PetrusHahol/terraform-provider-contrail). We are looking forward to somebody who has an interest to extend our solution, write test, documentation for heading to the upstream afterwords.

## Contrail Releases and Versions

This provider aims to support 4.1 version of contrail API.
We try to support all releases of Contrail when we can.
