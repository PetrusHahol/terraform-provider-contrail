If there is no resource you need, you can try to use resource according to sources but we don't provide 100% that it will work because we didn't test it.

* contrail_virtual_machine_interface
* contrail_virtual_machine_interface_refs
* contrail_virtual_network
* contrail_virtual_network_refs
* contrail_tag

Contrail objects have separate definition of a resource and relationships between them if relation is not required in time of resource creation. 
Resources with `_refs` postfix mean relation between objects.   

For all contrail resources `default_name` variable is required.
